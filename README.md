# CAP
CAP stands for Cold Air Pooling. This project is a research project with Western Colorado University that looks into the unique temperature inversion phenomenon that occurs in the Gunnison Valley. I am focused on analysing the temperature data that the team is collecting in the valley and producing data visualization and data-driven results.

The Cold Air Pooling research team is made up of six individuals, all integrated in diverse ways within the Gunnison community. Professor Suzanne Taylor is the main Western faculty member involved with CAP. The goal of the CAP teamâ€™s research is to measure and describe collections of cold air in the Gunnison valley. We aim to measure, with temperature sensors, the temperature at various locations within the Gunnison valley, heading up the Ohio creek drainage. Through analyzing and organizing the data CAP hopes to gain insight into potential causes of cold pockets of air in the Gunnison valley. My role in CAP is data scientist.
