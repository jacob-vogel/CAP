# CAP
CAP stands for Cold Air Pooling. This project is a research project with Western Colorado University that looks into the unique temperature inversion phenomenon that occurs in the Gunnison Valley. I am focused on analysing the temperature data that the team is collecting in the valley and producing data visualization and data-driven results.
